     <p>Rounding out the Top 25, the Greninja/Samus player AutoMagic would make waves early on in HDR’s life with a 2nd place at the first HDR major Undertow 2022. From there he would travel over to Frosty Faustings 2023, in an attempt to keep up the momentum and make a real effort towards sealing himself as one of the best to grace the sticks. He would go on to secure a solid 4th place finish amassing wins over Kicker, Tspeeds, S.N.E.S.s and Nibbs.</p>
     <p>As the year progressed, AutoMagic would continue to expand his character roster as he entered more events, all while providing some of the craziest clips. Finishing off the latter half of 2023, AutoMagic would invade Waypoint Rumble 2, finishing 4th and then going to win Sunset in Sapulpa over Domlax, Tia and Ben L x2. Overall, he has proven to be a major bracket threat and someone who shouldn't be taken lightly if you find him in your path.</p>

     <p>JM1-3 follows up on his successful trial run of HDR at Undertow 2022 with a ripe #24 spot on the HDRankfor the year. Despite already committing to a game in Rivals Workshop, Jordan’s presence within the HDR community is certainly felt at every bracket he goes to. The Pennsylvania native found a strong balance between these two games and proved that despite not owning the game during Undertow 2022, he could still come in, learn, and compete with several of the top dogs coming in from other scenes.</p>
     <p>Jordan started his year off hot, clinching a 2nd place finish at Gigaton Hammer going solo Plant, only sporting losses to an uncrowned queen in Frozen at the time while taking out Jut, Rex, and Hobbes2 all in losers. After the event that night, Jordan was playing friendlies with a few people, hovered over Isabelle, then out loud said “Why would anyone look at all these characters on the screen and pick Isabelle?”</p>
     <p> In the most “f*** around and find out” way, Jordan then discovered his main character for the rest of the year. He’d use her for brackets like High Rez where we saw him take sets off of Arhungry and SolarBeam before bowing out to Kamex in losers, who he would end up getting his revenge on at Undertow 2023 on the way to clean 9th place at the event. His Isabelle’s run would turn sour when changes were made post-Undertow to weaken the character, which is when he then turned his face to Pokemon Trainer and has yet to look back ever since. We’ve already seen that his Trainer can get to a similar point of his Isabelle, even netting another win on Kamex at the November edition of Cream of the Crop. As he gets more acquainted with his new trio, we can only hope to see him show up more and bring in more heads from the Workshop scene. Who knows, maybe he’ll get a few HDR players to get into Workshop!</p>

     <p>It's pretty safe to say that if there was any HDR event anywhere, Kamex was most likely there as well. Entering a whopping 17 qualifying events for the 2023 season, the Duck Hunt expert with his Jigglypuff secondary were able to secure their place at rank 23. At a handful of events early on and sprinkled throughout the season, he would place right outside of the top eight while still clinching wins on players such as Grunk, Anchor, Beast and Lardo. With all the experience gained from the sheer amount of tournaments Kamex went to, it was only a matter of time before some breakout performances occurred.</p>
     <p>First it would come to fruition at Meteor 2, where he would place 5th earning wins on Mini, Mr.Watch&Learn, Max Ketchum and Mlarcin. This would be followed up immediately by a 4th place finish at High Rez where Kamex would defeat JM1-3 and Papaya as well as earning repeat wins on Beast and Max. It's safe to say that with the amount of travel and consistent performances, this won’t be the first time we see Kamex appear in the Top 50.</p>

     <p>Although his tweets might fool some people into thinking Jut is only a comedian, he’s shown to be a threat on the sticks for any opponent that lies in his bracket path. The Project M enthusiast, NASB2 play tester, and former NJ Ultimate PR player started the year with a 7th place finish at Gigaton Hammer, the first HDR major of the year. Traveling from the northeast to both Carolinas, Illinois, and Virginia during 2023, Jut has shown his skills across the country with consistent placings and quality wins on Arhungry, Anchor, Hobbes2, and JM1-3. Despite his home region being one of the strongest regions for HDR in Tristate, Jut finished in the top 12 of every event he entered this year.</p>
     <p>While his Wolf has had the spotlight at big events in 2023, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see Jut continue making top 8s in 2024 with Wolf and even more characters. Tristate locals have seen the full force of Jut’s character roster, from Wario to Mega Man to whoever else catches his eye on the character select screen, all of them seemingly at a similar skill to his main. Whether Jut has more banger tweets or Wolf flash kills in bracket is a question that is currently unsolved, but regardless of the answer, he’ll go wherever an HDR setup is to show off his fast paced gameplay and the latest broken character in the nightly build.</p>

     <p>Landing at the #21 spot is New Jersey’s man of many mains, Lardo. With a playstyle as enigmatic and versatile as his character pool, Lardo has found success in and out of region with a multitude of characters which is quite the feat. In a game as young as HDR oftentimes characters have drastic changes to their kits and gameplay as betas come and go. However, Lardo shows this to be of little concern to him, piloting more characters in brackets than we can include on the graphic. Although you would think he mains the random button, when it’s time to get down to business you can expect to see him on his powerhouse King Dedede making quick work of those who look to challenge him and the self-proclaimed King of Dreamland. </p>
     <p>Lardo would make his breakout onto the national scene with a trip up to the great white north for Randall’s Room. Here he would show that ice cold competition was nothing to him and pushed through the blizzard until ultimately falling to Canada’s King of Modded Smash, Rongunshu. From here he’d claw his way to a 3rd place finish falling to Ravenking in losers finals. Lardo would return home to Tristate a powerful threat, showing this 3rd place finish was no fluke. He would watch his resume grow more and more prestigious as he would pick up wins on many of Tristate's finest such as Rex, Beast, Papaya and JM1-3 to name a few. Armed with an ever growing arsenal of characters all with the common goal of infuriating their opponents at every interaction, we can only expect to see Lardo make a bigger and bolder name for himself in 2024.</p>

     <p>There has yet to be a road that stingers hasn’t driven on in his smash career. He’s been on the Melee highway, traveled all along the Brawl interstate, took the Project M backroads to get to exit Smash 4, and even stopped at the 4XM rest stop before contemplating whether to stay on track towards the Ultimate freeway or to deviate and go back towards those familiar backroads he was at before where new openings have opened up. Judging by the whopping eight characters he used throughout last year, I think it’s safe to say that he’s enjoying his cruise through the roads of HDR. Despite having characters like Villager in the pocket for things like doubles, we saw stingers eventually land on the group of Aegis, Samus, and Robin when it came to the bigger brackets. How he’s able to juggle all of these characters at once is a mystery to everyone, but it certainly shows that this old driver still has what it takes to be up here with the newer and younger generation.
    </p>
     <p>Despite only having five qualified brackets for the year, stingers made sure to make the most of the openings that were given to him. He instantly kicked off the year with a bracket win at Codename: Smash Next Door without dropping a single game against the likes of Jut, Ashtoric, and Hobbes2 before getting bullied out of The Doghouse by top Ultimate players Anathema and moxi. Lightning decided to strike twice at Patchwork where we would see him lose to the newly minted #14 on the SSBMRank, Salt, and also another top Ultimate player in Juanpi. After this, he decided to take his talents to Warp Zone 2 only to face an early bracket loss to the local Illinois dede-demon in evilest lesbian.</p>
     <p> This early upset wouldn’t disturb stingers however, as he would break the game-invasion player curse early on by beating fair, 22james, and Terrion before getting his runback on evil lesbian in a game five barnburner. He’d end up losing to Ravenking in another game 5 ending his run at 5th, but he would take these losses into account and add Samus to his arsenal of characters. We would see him return for his first qualified bracket in 3 months at Kayla’s Spooky Smash 3, where we’d see a surge back to form to win the bracket over a revitalized Jut, Ben L, and two wins over the titan of the development team member Wish (f.k.a JFyst). With the game-invasion curse now lifted and now being a contributor to the mod, we can expect a lot more coming from this guy going into the new season whether it's in-game, or in-person.</p>

     <p>Samuel Quick aka Mr. Quick is one of HewDraw Remix’s most prominent multi-game talents. Throughout 2023 alone, they entered brackets for Tekken 8, Granblue, Strive, Street Fighter 6, Smash Ultimate, Melee and of course, HDR. Their home state of Oklahoma has been one of the hotbeds for modded Smash top players over the last year, with Mr. Quick’s Falco bubbling to the very top. </p>
     <p>Quick’s HDR career started in the later half of the ranking period, putting them on the lower side of qualifying events entered compared to the other players on this list. However, that didn’t stop him from having knock out performances in all of these qualifying brackets. This includes a 1st place out of 35 at Waypoint Rumble 2 and a silver medal at LA Super Nexus VII where they double eliminated LMMM winner Kryu. It’s clear that, both instate and abroad, Mr. Quick has the skills to compete with the best.</p>

     <p>Everyone’s favorite Bear n’ Bird believer is back yet again to leave his mark on another modded smash title. This time, he sports the highest rank he has yet to have across any game, debuting at #19 on the HDRank. Mr.Watch&Learn is lovable no matter what he’s doing, whether it’s TOing Cream of the Crop, providing insightful commentary while spitting out hilarious quips, or up smashing us to send us crying into the blast zone at 80%. He’s also one of the most active players this season, with the help of him flying out to the midwest not just once, but twice to show his love for the game and the community. When asked about his thoughts on getting ranked in the top 20 this season, this is what he had to say: "How tf yall let a dude play the game for like 3 months and get top 20 level Ult heads BTFO LMAOOOOO."</p>
     <p>He wouldn’t start his venture into HDR rocking the rare (limited) duo at first though, originally starting with Incineroar at Lake George Showdown before Banjo was given the new tools that he has today, but that was all he needed to start cooking. He stayed in the lab until June’s Cream of The Crop and let the bird fly to a 5th-place finish with wins over Billy Schilly and Rex. Having the duo in Tristate’s eyes wasn’t his only intention though, he wanted everyone to see the bear and bird on display with full force, so he decided to travel out to Warp Zone 2.</p>
     <p>It was that weekend when Spencer proved to people that Banjo should be respected in the metagame as he acquired set wins on Star and Ravenking at the pre-local, while also netting an additional win on Jackson during the main bracket. We would see him translate that success into stronger bracket runs in-region with two 3rd place showings at Emergency Run That Back Again! and Blacklisted 8, but it would all come to fruition when he trespassed onto Iowa grounds at Honeypot 8 where he would make top 8 with wins over Nebraska’s HDK and 22james. Even though the bear and the bird have had some unfavorable changes as of late, we can be safe to assume that Spencer will find his footing and continue to beat up his friends no matter what the modded title is.

     <p>There’s something to be said about tournament organizers being good at mod games, and Face is a prime example of that statement. A longtime competitor dating back to the Brawl and PM days, he continues to show his prowess in HDR with Zelda leading the way to his success while also operating the AON venue in Long Island for most of the year. One of the most consistent competitors on this list, Face finished in the top eight of all but one event he entered this year while earning wins on Raventoli, Marcus, Papaya, and Arhungry.</p>
     <p>Perhaps the most impressive feat is his performance at The Underground, the Smash Con shadow major that almost didn’t happen. With about a week before the event and no word on a venue able to host HDR, Face led the team that put together the event, purchasing chairs from the nearby Walmart and putting together ten setups in his hotel room (including the infamous bathroom setup) until 3 am. Between calling matches through Discord to players waiting in the hotel lobby and reporting sets, he defeated Max Ketchum and Arhungry en route to a 7th place finish. Whether Face is TOing, competing, or doing both at the same time, he’s an opponent any competitor would be scared to see in their bracket path.</p>

     <p>No matter what specific smash community you belong to in Tristate, you have surely been on the receiving end of the electrifying knee of rising Falcon multi-game one trick Anchor. An upstanding member of the community and triple threat in Melee, Project M, and HDR, this New Jersey native is constantly showing his growing efficiency and mastery of the F-Zero star across all iterations of the character. However, it is here in the growing landscape of HDR that Anchor has found a solid footing and, alongside his fellow pilot Ozma, has begun to mold and push the Falcon meta to heights not yet seen and show a new side to Douglas’ ever growing resume of flashy playstyles. Although met with some roadblocks along the way, Anchor piloted the Blue Falcon to a 16th place finish on this inaugural ranking.</p>
     <p>Anchor sports a hefty resume for this year and saw a powerful tour across the east coasts with stops in Virginia for The Underground and Massachusetts for Shine out of Shield, boasting top six finishes at both with collective wins over Face, Papaya, Average Alex and Mlarcin. At The Scarlet Classic 2023 we would see Anchor first show that spark of greatness with a 2nd place finish with a grand finals reset over Marcus. He would also see victory over GuyGuy, Rivers, and Papaya on this run. From there Anchor would build quite a powerful resume throughout the rest of the year seeing victory over the likes of Average Alex, Mlarcin, Face and Mr. Mojo Risin’. With a burning desire to improve his Falcon in every way and game, we can only expect to see this Falcon ace pilot the Blue Falcon to even stronger 2024.</p>
